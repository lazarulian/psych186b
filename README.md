## Course Overview
In class, we covered the basics of neural networks, starting with their history and moving on to essential mathematical concepts like vector calculations and linear algebra. We explored linear associators and how they correct errors using the Delta learning rule. Understanding lateral inhibition gave us a real-life example of neural network behavior. Perceptrons were introduced as a significant step towards nonlinear networks. We also learned about back propagation for error correction in supervised learning. Practical applications were demonstrated through classic examples like the Traveling Salesman Problem and Hopfield networks for memory recall.

Objective: To create a machine learning model capable of classifying music samples into different genres based on audio signals.
Motivation: Automating music classification to streamline the selection process, uncover trends, and facilitate easier discovery of music.
Dataset: Utilization of the GTZAN Genre Classification dataset, which includes 1,000 audio tracks across 10 genres, each 30 seconds long.
